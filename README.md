# KNIME
Data Analysis and machine learning using KNIME software
In this project, I undertook the process of data ingestion from Excel spreadsheets, followed by a comprehensive data preprocessing and cleaning phase. Subsequently, I conducted a rigorous data analysis, exploring and uncovering meaningful insights from the dataset. The project also involved the development and application of regression machine learning techniques to model and predict specific target variables. Furthermore, data visualizations were employed to facilitate the interpretation and communication of key findings, enhancing the project's overall effectiveness and impact.
